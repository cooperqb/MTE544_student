Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful day. If you are reading this, you will have noticed there is only one csv in this folder. This is the data for map two, goal two. Unfortunately, since the instruction to save all csv files was specified at the very end of the manual, I neglected to save the other three CSV files. I do not have time to redo the plots to get these files. Please accept my humble apologies.

Best wishes,

Cooper
